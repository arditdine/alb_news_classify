Rusia, një aleate e qeverisë së Sirisë, donte ndryshime. Diplomatët perëndimorë akuzuan Rusinë se po zvarritej për kohën.Sekretari i Përgjithshëm i OKB-së, Antonio Guterres, më parë tha se situata në Ghoutan Lindore ishte si “ferri në Tokë”.I dërguari i SHBA në OKB bëri thirrje që armëpushimi të zbatohej menjëherë.24 shkurt 2018 (gazeta-Shqip.com)
